# TypeGraphQL + TypeORM + Docker

This project is a starter to build a NodeJS app using:
- TypeScript
- TypeGraphQL to generate a GraphQL API from TypeScript classes
- TypeORM as an ORM to use entities and connect with a PostgreSql database
- Docker to build and run the project on all platforms

Please note that the project uses Docker for both production and dev. 

To work on the project, just use `npm start` and start editing `.ts` files!
